# Airbnb Clone (HTML & CSS Only)

This is a clone of the Airbnb homepage, built using pure HTML and CSS.

I created this project as part of my learning journey through a front-end development bootcamp. The goal was to understand layout design, styling techniques, and how real-world UIs are structured using core web technologies.

## Features

- Sticky header with logo and navigation
- Search bar and profile section
- Styled layout similar to Airbnb's homepage
- Responsive design (if added)

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3

## What I Learned

- Structuring semantic HTML
- Styling with Flexbox and positioning
- Custom fonts and SVG/icon usage
- Web design fundamentals

## Acknowledgements

- Built as a practice project based on learnings from a bootcamp
- Inspired by the Airbnb website UI

## Note

This is a practice project for learning purposes and is not affiliated with Airbnb.
